                <h2>Detailed Summary</h2>
                <div class="summary-content">
                    <p>Matthew's Gospel is structured around five major discourses of Jesus, often concluding with the phrase "When Jesus finished these sayings..." (e.g., 7:28, 11:1, 13:53, 19:1, 26:1). This literary structure highlights Jesus' role as a new Moses, giving authoritative teaching to His people.</p>

                    <h3>Key Themes Explored:</h3>
                    <ul class="theme-list">
                        <li><strong>Jesus as Messiah and King:</strong> Matthew begins with Jesus' genealogy linking Him to Abraham and David, asserting His royal lineage and claim as the promised Messiah.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Kingdom of Heaven:</strong> This central concept describes God's reign and the sphere where His will is done. Jesus' miracles, teachings, and actions demonstrate the presence and power of the Kingdom.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fulfillment of Prophecy:</strong> Matthew frequently quotes the Old Testament to show how Jesus' birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection fulfill ancient predictions about the Messiah.</li>
                        <li><strong>Righteousness:</strong> Jesus emphasizes a righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt 5:20), focusing on inner attitudes and genuine devotion to God, not just external obedience.</li>
                         <li><strong>Discipleship:</strong> The Gospel calls readers to follow Jesus, teaching them what it means to live under the authority of the King in the Kingdom of Heaven.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3><i class="icon-pencil"></i> Authorship:</h3> <!-- Placeholder icon -->
                        <p>Traditional Christian belief attributes the Gospel to Matthew (also called Levi), one of the twelve apostles, a former tax collector. This view is supported by early church fathers like Papias, Irenaeus, and Origen, who claimed Matthew compiled Jesus' sayings (logia) in Aramaic or Hebrew, which were then translated or incorporated into the Greek Gospel we have today. While some modern scholars debate the direct authorship by the apostle, the Gospel clearly reflects a perspective deeply familiar with Jewish customs and scriptures.</p>

                        <p>Pinpointing the exact date is debated. Estimates range from the 50s AD to the late 80s or 90s AD. A widely accepted range is <strong>65-85 AD</strong>. Evidence suggesting a later date includes the apparent use of Mark's Gospel (written around 60-70 AD) and references that some interpret as allusions to the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 AD (though these prophecies could be genuine foresight by Jesus). An earlier date is supported by the tradition linking it to an apostle and its Jewish focus, which might fit better before the complete split between Judaism and Christianity.</p>

                        <p>The Gospel's content and style strongly suggest it was written primarily for a <strong>Jewish Christian audience</strong>. Matthew assumes his readers understand Jewish customs (like handwashing rituals, though he does explain some things like the Mount of Olives prophecy in 24:3), references the Old Testament extensively using fulfillment formulas ("this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet..."), and presents Jesus' lineage through Abraham and David. The audience was likely dealing with questions about how Jesus related to the Law and the Prophets, and how the Kingdom of God was unfolding in light of the Messiah's coming and the changing religious landscape.</p>

                        <p>Matthew wrote to persuade his Jewish audience that <strong>Jesus is the Messiah</strong>, the Son of David, the King of Israel, and the Son of God, who fulfills the promises of the Old Testament. He also aimed to provide a manual for Christian discipleship and the life of the church community, outlining Jesus' teachings on ethics, prayer, mission, and eschatology.</p>
